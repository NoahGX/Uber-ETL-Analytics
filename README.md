# Uber Data Analytics

## Overview
This project aims to perform data analytics on Uber data using modern data engineering tools and technologies. The workflow includes data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, Python, and Mageâ€”AI to build a modern data pipeline tool. The ultimate goal is to derive meaningful insights from Uber trip records by processing and analyzing the data efficiently.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Utilize GCP Storage to securely store raw data on Uber trips.
- **Data Processing**: Implement data transformation, and cleaning using Python and Mage AI to ensure quality and consistency.
- **Data Warehousing**: Load the processed data into BigQuery for scalable and efficient querying.
- **Data Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards and reports using Looker Studio to visualize key metrics and trends.
